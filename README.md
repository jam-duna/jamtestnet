# JAM Testnet 

[JAM](https://jam.web3.foundation/) is the anticipated future protocol for Polkadot, being implemented by multiple teams across different programming languages. The [JAM Gray Paper](https://graypaper.com/) outlines the protocol, and the Web3 Foundation has shared initial test vectors with participating teams [here](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors).

This repository serves as a collaborative space for teams to develop and test JAM Testnets independently and work towards cross-team compatibility in the JAM Toaster.   See [docs.jamcha.in](https://docs.jamcha.in/). 

## Dev Accounts, Chain specs, Genesis States

### Dev Accounts

To support testing in a wide variety of network sizes from "tiny"
(V=6) to "full" (V=1023), we follow the W3F test vectors in having
public secret keys derived deterministically from publicly known
seeds for Ed25519, Bandersnatch, and BLS keys.

Using these seeds, secret and public keys can be programmatically generated, ensuring each JAM team can run the public testnet consistently. This is strictly for development purposes.

An open-source `key` program is used to map seeds into  Bandersnatch/Ed25519/BLS secret and public keys.  See [here](./key) showing how to map any seed.

See [Dev Accounts](https://docs.jamcha.in/basics/dev-accounts) 32-byte seeds.

### Chain Specs

Chain specs for 8 network sizes have been modeled and published.
* [jamtestnet (JSON)](./chainspecs.json)
* [docs.jamcha.in](https://docs.jamcha.in/basics/chain-spec)
* [JAM Chain specs (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ueAisCMOx7B-m_fXMLT0FXBxfVzydJyr-udE8jKwDN8/edit?gid=615049643#gid=615049643)

## State Transition Test Vectors

Sharing excerpts of blockchain state and validating state transitions is a valuable prerequisite before 2 or more teams can set up a JAM Testnet.

By using a public genesis state, teams can collaborate by sharing state transitions (pre-state, block, post-state). This allows for verifying that different implementations can read key objects and
perform the identical state transitions in accordance with the GP Spec and prepare to pass "M1 Import Blocks".

* blocks: `$epoch_$phase.json`  `$epoch_$phase.bin` -- follows [w3f block test vectors](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/block.json)
* state_snapshots: `$epoch_$phase.json`  `$epoch_$phase.bin` -- JSON + Codec developer-friendly states following [w3f STF test vectors](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/tree/master/safrole/tiny)
* state_transitions: `$epoch_$phase.json`  `$epoch_$phase.bin` --  JSON + Codec machine-friendly state transitions


## State Transitions Data

Based on [JAM0 - JAM Implementers Meetup @ sub0/Devcon 7](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/jam0-jam-implementers-meetup-sub0-devcon-7-bangkok-nov-11-nov-16-2024/10866/1) we built the following datasets:

* [fallback](./data/fallback) -- The `fallback` mode does not involve any PVM execution or extrinsics.  See [Sealing Test Vectors](https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/issues/21).
* [safrole](./data/safrole) -- The `safrole` mode adds extrinsic tickets.  Here is a draft of the shape of `mode=safrole` here:
* [assurances](./data/assurances) -- The `assurances` mode adds a few tiny services (bootstrap, fib) and requires E_G, E_A, E_P extrinsics as well as a basic PVM implementation with a few host functions implemented (new, write, read).
* [orderedaccumulation](./data/orderedaccumulation) -- The `orderedaccumulation` mode uses both cores to run through simple cases of package dependencies and ordered accumulation with "fib", "trib" and "megatron" services.

Within each directory is a trace of logging activity, as generated by JAM DUNA.  This may assist in identifying discrepancies between implementations.

See [services](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/polkavm/tree/dev/services) for all service code (bootstrap, fib, trib, corevm, corevm-child, etc.), which has been compiled with [polkatool](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/building-jam-services-in-rust/10161).  

| `mode`                    | `fallback`|   `safrole` | `assurances` | `orderedaccumulation` | `dispute`|
|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Tickets: E_T              |           |       x     |     x       |     x      |x|
| Guarantees: E_G           |           |             |     x       |     x      |x|
| Assurances: E_A           |           |             |     x       |     x      |x|
| Preimages: E_P            |           |             |     x       |     x      |x|
| Refine/Accumulate PVM     |           |             |     x       |     x      |x|
| Bootstrap Services        |           |             |     x       |     x      |x|
| Ordered Accumulation      |           |             |             |     x      |x|

As of Feb 2025, several teams have reported success at importing both fallback and safrole,
and as of March 2025, several teams have reported 100% alignment on `assurances` and `orderedaccumulation` for this [0.6.2.12](https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/releases/tag/0.6.2.12) dataset.  

As of late March 2025, we are starting again with [0.6.4.x](https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/releases/)

#### Assurances

The assurances dataset, after setting up a "Bootstrap" and "Fib" service (setup using the Bootstrap service), tests out the majority of `accumulate` host functions:

* ASSIGN
* BLESS
* CHECKPOINT
* EJECT
* FORGET
* GAS
* INFO
* LOOKUP
* NEW
* QUERY
* READ
* SOLICIT
* TRANSFER
* UPGRADE
* WRITE
* YIELD
* LOG

See [assurances.txt](./assurances.txt).  As of 0.6.4 we use the [LOG host function call](https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jip1) liberally, which shows writes out the result of the host function result in many of the calls along with the gas result.  

As of 0.6.4, we have `refine` using all of the following:

* EXPORT
* EXPUNGE
* FETCH
* GAS
* INVOKE
* MACHINE
* PEEK
* POKE 

We will defer basic testing DESIGNATE, UPGRADE, EJECT, VOID+ZERO to after a live tiny testnet has been set up.

#### Ordered Accumulation

The ordered accumulation data, after setting up a Fib+Trib+Megatron service, has the megatron work package depend on the Fib+Trib work package.  

`Meg(N) = Fib(N) + Trib(N)` computed in the same state transition, which forces _ordered accumulation_ (See Sec 12).

* Fib is basically like the above but does not have any host function testing -- it just does Fib(N) = Fib(N-1) + Fib(N-2)
* Trib is like Fib but Trib(N) = Trib(N-1) + Trib(N-2) + Trib(N-3)
* The Fib+Trib workpackage has TWO work items.   Meg(N) is computed in a separate work package but with the Fib+Trib work package as prereqs.

You can see the results of these in [orderedaccumulation.txt](./orderedaccumulation.txt).

#### Guarantees

In the `guarantees` folder you will see many guarantee test vectors generated in assurances and ordered accumulation tests.  Each JSON file contains a signed guarantee along with the work report and availability specifier AND the following:
* work package bundle (with the work package, imported segments, justifications) and segment root lookup
* guarantee derivation components: bclub, sclub, and bundle chunks and segment chunks

10 of the guarantee test vectors are an indepedent run Fib(1)-Fib(10) (see [assurances.txt](./assurances.txt)), and FETCH and EXPORT a matching number of segments.

Having community alignment on this will prove an essential prerequisite to a multi-client testnet that can refine work packages.

#### Dispute
- made by any mode with guarantee and assurance
- only the availible workreports can be disputed (the dispute always happen after audit)
- we choose the STF vectors that contain availible workreports and ramdomly assign to goodset,badset and wonkeyset

## Fuzzed State Transitions

In addition, inside `data` are additional "fuzzed" datasets consisting of **INVALID** state transitions:

  * [safrole/state_transitions_fuzzed](./data/safrole/state_transitions_fuzzed)
  * [assurances/state_transitions_fuzzed](./data/assurances/state_transitions_fuzzed)

StateTransition Errors are organized into 4 categories, tracking W3F official error codes and descriptions:

  * [x] **T** - Safrole Ticket Errors
  * [x] **A** - Assurances Errors
  * [ ] **G** - Guarantee & Work Reports Errors 
  * [ ] **D** - Disputes Errors

We enumerate them below.
