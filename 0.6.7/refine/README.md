# WorkReport Test Procedure

## Objective
The purpose of this test is to verify that a given node can execute a recorded **Work Package Bundle** starting from a known state and produce a **WorkReport** that matches the expected result.

## Test Flow
1. **Initialize the node with a known state**  
   Load the nodeâ€™s state from the snapshot of a specific `StateTransition` to ensure a deterministic starting point.

2. **Load the Work Package Bundle Snapshot**  
   Use the recorded **BundleSnapshot** data, which contains:
   - The `package_hash` and `core_index`
   - The full `bundle` (work package, extrinsics, justifications, imports)
   - `segment_root_lookup`
   - The expected `slot`
   - The reference **WorkReport** to compare against

3. **Execute the Work Package Bundle**  
   Run the bundle through the node with the same execution environment (including the same PVM backend) as in the original run.  This step should produce a newly generated **WorkReport**

4. **Validate the Execution**  
   - Compare the generated **WorkReport** with the recorded reference report

## BundleSnapshot Contents
A BundleSnapshot should contain everything needed to re-run the package:
- **Work package details**: authorization, authorizer, context, items list (with service IDs, code hashes, payloads, gas limits, imports/exports)
- **Execution context**: anchors, state roots, beefy roots, lookup anchors
- **Segment root lookup**
- **Slot number**
- **Reference WorkReport**: package spec, context, authorizer hash, results, gas usage, and other metadata

**Example:**
```json
{
  "package_hash": "...",
  "core_index": 0,
  "bundle": { ... },
  "segment_root_lookup": [],
  "slot": 3258991,
  "report": { ... }
}
```
